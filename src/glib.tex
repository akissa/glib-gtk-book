\chapter{GLib, the core library}

GLib is the low-level core library that forms the basis for projects such as GTK+ and GNOME. It provides data structures, utility functions, portability wrappers, and other essential functionality such as an event loop and threads.

%TODO take the GGAD (from Havoc Pennington) GLib chapter and update it.
